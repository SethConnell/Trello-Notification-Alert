# Trello-Notification-Alert
I use Trello... a lot. Sadly, I don't always know when somebody is tagging me on Trello cards. So to fix this, I decided to built this alert system that automatically sends a text to my phone whenever it sees a new notification.

I set up a MySQL database to save previous messages, allowing the script to ignore messages I've already recieved by text.


## What You Need:

Assuming you actually want to use this code, you are going to need a few things.

* Selenium for Python. - Google how to install that.
* PyMySQL for Connecting to MySQL.
* A MySQL server up and running.
* A phone that can receive text messages.
* A working account on Trello.
* API access on Trello.

If you don't have the things listed above, this code will scream error messages at you.

## A Simple Guide:
Open Data.py and fill in the correct data. Then run it!
